Yaaic - Yet Another Android IRC Client

Yaaic is as the full name already says an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
client for Android devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code distribution of Yaaic. If you are looking
for a compiled 'ready to use' version (APK), see the official
homepage at:

 http://www.yaaic.org

Yaaic is also avaiable at the official Android market.

If you are a developer and want to contribute to Yaaic, checkout
our repository at github:

 http://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic

The application project is located in application/ while the test/
folder contains unit and scenario tests. (Both folders are two
separate eclipse projects!)
